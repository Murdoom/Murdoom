Greetings fellow human-beings! I'm Murdoom/Ben. 
I'm interest in learning code and such for game-dev in the future. I've always wanted to tell a story and known that computers aren't magic as well as 
always wanting to try my hand at tech, so here I am. 
Currently, I'm learning through freecodecamp.org and going through the CSS portion of the beginers classes. Pretty basic stuff, I know. Gotta walk before you can run. 
There are a few ways to reatch me, but I think I'll just post my Linktr.ee here:
